Breadcrumbs are a good way to display your current location. This is usually used when you have multiple layers of content.

## Scale

Use this scale in and out elements. Make sure to add the base transition class scale-transition. Then add the class scale-out to scale the element down until it is hidden. To start something as hidden, add the class scale-out first, and then add the class scale-in to scale the element up until it is shown.


```html
<nav>
   <div class="nav-wrapper">
      <div class="col s12">
         <a href="#!" class="breadcrumb">First</a>
         <a href="#!" class="breadcrumb">Second</a>
         <a href="#!" class="breadcrumb">Third</a>
      </div>
   </div>
</nav>
```
