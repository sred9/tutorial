## Headers

We provide some basic styling on header tags. In the example, you can see the the 6 header tags' different sizes.

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are mainly used to give emphasis to a quote or citation. You can also use these for some extra text hierarchy and emphasis.

```html
<blockquote>
  This is an example quotation that uses the blockquote tag.
</blockquote>
```

## Flow Text

To use flow-text on a body of text, simply just add the class flow-text to a tag, see the code below.

```html
<p class="flow-text">I am Flow Text</p>
```
