Waves is an external library that we've included in Materialize to allow us to create the ink effect outlined in Material Design.

## Applying Waves

```html
<a class="waves-effect waves-light btn-large" href="#">Wave</a>
```

## Circle Buttons

If you want waves to form to a non rectangular shape, there is an option for circular waves. Just add the waves-circle in addition to waves-effect.

```html
<a href="#!" class="waves-effect waves-circle waves-light btn-floating secondary-content">
  <i class="material-icons">add</i>
</a>
```
