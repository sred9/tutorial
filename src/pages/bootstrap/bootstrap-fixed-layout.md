Draw attention to your buttons with this subtle but captivating effect. Just add the class pulse to your button. Note: This is meant for floating buttons, so it may not work perfectly with every component.

```html
<a class="btn-floating pulse"><i class="material-icons">menu</i></a>
<a class="btn-floating btn-large pulse"><i class="material-icons">cloud</i></a>
<a class="btn-floating btn-large cyan pulse"><i class="material-icons">edit</i></a>
```
