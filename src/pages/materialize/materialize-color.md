Materialize CSS comes with a predefined color palette based on material design language by Google. Materialize CSS 	makes it easier to apply text and background colors right from HTML without getting into CSS. 

## Background Color

To scale in and out elements, first add the base transition class `scale-transition` to the element. Then you can add the class `scale-out` to scale the element down until it is hidden and add the class `scale-in` to scale the element up until it is visible.

To apply a background color, just add the color name and light/darkness as a class to the wrapping element.

```html
<div class="card-panel teal lighten-2">This is a card panel with a teal lighten-2 class</div>
```

## Text Color

To apply a text color, just append -text to the color class like this:

```html
<div class="card-panel">
  <span class="blue-text text-darken-2">This is a card panel with dark blue text</span>
</div>
```
